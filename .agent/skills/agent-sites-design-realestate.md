# Agent Sites Design Skill (Real Estate)

This skill provides the design and conversion logic for the `aiBuilder` to create premium, luxury-focused real estate websites for Dubai brokers.

## Design Philosophy: "The Eden House Aesthetic"

- **Aroma of Luxury**: Use a refined color palette (e.g., Deep Navy, Champagne Gold, Slate Gray, or Off-White). Avoid "standard" web colors.
- **Generous Whitespace**: Ensure elements have room to breathe. High-end design is defined by what you leave out as much as what you put in.
- **Typography**: 
    - *Headings*: Serif or high-contrast Sans-Serif (e.g., Playfair Display, Inter Tight).
    - *Body*: Clean, highly legible Sans-Serif (e.g., Inter, Montserrat).
- **Mobile-First**: Every layout must be perfectly responsive. Brokers and clients primarily use mobile/WhatsApp.

## Page Structure & Sections

### 1. Home Page (The Hook)
- **Hero Section**:
    - *Headline*: Benefit-driven (e.g., "Your Gateway to Dubai's Most Exclusive Addresses").
    - *Imagery*: High-resolution, aspirational property or area shots.
    - *Primary CTA*: Prominent Lead Capture (e.g., "Start Your Search").
- **Featured Listings**: A curated grid of 3-4 top properties.
- **About Teaser**: A brief, warm introduction with a "Read More" link.
- **Focus areas**: Icon-based grid of specialized communities.

### 2. About Page (The Trust)
- **Detailed Bio**: The story of the agent, their values, and their track record.
- **Professional Stats**: Large, bold numbers (e.g., "500+ Deals Closed", "10+ Years Experience").
- **Services**: A clear breakdown of what the agent offers (Buying, Selling, Advisory).

### 3. Listings Page (The Inventory)
- **Clean Grid/List View**: High-quality thumbnails with key details (Price, Beds, Baths, SqFt).
- **Filtering**: (If supported) simple community/type filtering.

### 4. Contact Page (The Conversion)
- **Integrated Form**: Simple fields (Name, Phone, Interest).
- **Quick Links**: Direct WhatsApp button and phone link.

## Conversion & UX Rules

- **CTA Placement**: A "Floating" WhatsApp button should be visible on all pages.
- **Micro-Animations**: Subtle fade-ins and hover effects on property cards to feel "expensive".
- **Social Proof**: Testimonials should be prominently displayed on the Home and About pages.
- **Lead Routing**: All forms must route directly to the agent's WhatsApp/CRM via the Auro backend.
