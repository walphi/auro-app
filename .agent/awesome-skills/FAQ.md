# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Got questions?** You're not alone! Here are answers to the most common questions about Antigravity Awesome Skills.

---

## 🎯 General Questions

### What are "skills" exactly?

Skills are specialized instruction files that teach AI assistants how to handle specific tasks. Think of them as expert knowledge modules that your AI can load on-demand.

**Simple analogy:** Just like you might consult different experts (a lawyer, a doctor, a mechanic), skills let your AI become an expert in different areas when you need them.

---

### Do I need to install all 233 skills?

**No!** When you clone the repository, all skills are available, but your AI only loads them when you explicitly invoke them with `@skill-name` or `/skill-name`.

It's like having a library - all the books are there, but you only read the ones you need.

---

### Which AI tools work with these skills?

These skills work with any AI coding assistant that supports the `SKILL.md` format:

- ✅ **Claude Code** (Anthropic CLI)
- ✅ **Gemini CLI** (Google)
- ✅ **Codex CLI** (OpenAI)
- ✅ **Cursor** (AI IDE)
- ✅ **Antigravity IDE**
- ✅ **OpenCode**
- ⚠️ **GitHub Copilot** (partial support)

---

### Are these skills free to use?

**Yes!** This repository is licensed under MIT License, which means:

- ✅ Free for personal use
- ✅ Free for commercial use
- ✅ You can modify them
- ✅ You can redistribute them

---

### Do skills work offline?

The skill files themselves are stored locally on your computer, but your AI assistant needs an internet connection to function. So:

- ✅ Skills are local files
- ❌ AI assistant needs internet

---

## Installation & Setup

### Where should I install the skills?

The universal path that works with most tools is `.agent/skills/`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .agent/skills
```

**Tool-specific paths:**

- Claude Code: `.claude/skills/` or `.agent/skills/`
- Gemini CLI: `.gemini/skills/` or `.agent/skills/`
- Cursor: `.cursor/skills/` or project root
- Antigravity: `.agent/skills/`

---

### Can I install skills in multiple projects?

**Yes!** You have two options:

**Option 1: Global Installation** (recommended)
Install once in your home directory, works for all projects:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .agent/skills
```

**Option 2: Per-Project Installation**
Install in each project directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .agent/skills
```

---

### How do I update skills to the latest version?

Navigate to your skills directory and pull the latest changes:

```bash
cd .agent/skills
git pull origin main
```

---

### Can I install only specific skills?

**Yes!** You can manually copy individual skill folders:

```bash
# Clone the full repo first
git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git temp-skills

# Copy only the skills you want
mkdir -p .agent/skills
cp -r temp-skills/skills/brainstorming .agent/skills/
cp -r temp-skills/skills/stripe-integration .agent/skills/

# Clean up
rm -rf temp-skills
```

---

## Using Skills

### How do I invoke a skill?

Use the `@` symbol followed by the skill name:

```
@skill-name your request here
```

**Examples:**

```
@brainstorming help me design a todo app
@stripe-integration add subscription billing
@systematic-debugging fix this test failure
```

Some tools also support `/skill-name` syntax.

---

### How do I know which skill to use?

**Method 1: Browse the README**
Check the [Full Skill Registry](README.md#full-skill-registry-233233) organized by category

**Method 2: Search by keyword**

```bash
ls skills/ | grep "keyword"
```

**Method 3: Ask your AI**

```
What skills are available for [topic]?
```

---

### Can I use multiple skills at once?

**Yes!** You can invoke multiple skills in the same conversation:

```
@brainstorming help me design this feature

[After brainstorming...]

@test-driven-development now let's implement it with tests
```

---

### What if a skill doesn't work?

**Troubleshooting steps:**

1. **Check installation path**

   ```bash
   ls .agent/skills/
   ```

2. **Verify skill exists**

   ```bash
   ls .agent/skills/skill-name/
   ```

3. **Check SKILL.md exists**

   ```bash
   cat .agent/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
   ```

4. **Try restarting your AI assistant**

5. **Check for typos in skill name**
   - Use `@brainstorming` not `@brain-storming`
   - Names are case-sensitive in some tools

6. **Report the issue**

## Technical Questions

### What's the difference between SKILL.md and README.md?

- **SKILL.md** (required): The actual skill definition that the AI reads
- **README.md** (optional): Human-readable documentation about the skill

The AI primarily uses `SKILL.md`, while developers read `README.md`.

---

### Can I use scripts or code in my skill?

**Yes!** Skills can include:

- `scripts/` - Helper scripts
- `examples/` - Example code
- `templates/` - Code templates
- `references/` - Documentation

Reference them in your `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
Run the setup script:
\`\`\`bash
bash scripts/setup.sh
\`\`\`
```

---

### What programming languages can skills cover?

**Any language!** Current skills cover:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- Go
- Rust
- Swift
- Kotlin
- Shell scripting
- And many more...

---

### Can skills call other skills?

**Yes!** Skills can reference other skills:

```markdown
## Workflow

1. First, use `@brainstorming` to design
2. Then, use `@writing-plans` to plan
3. Finally, use `@test-driven-development` to implement
```

---

### How do I validate my skill before submitting?

Run the validation script:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_skills.py
```

This checks:

- ✅ SKILL.md exists
- ✅ Frontmatter is valid
- ✅ Name matches folder name
- ✅ Description exists
